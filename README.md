StopAndFrisk is a Java program that loads NYPD stop-and-frisk CSV data, groups records by year, and computes simple analysis: filters by race, frisked vs arrested percentages, gender bias breakdowns, crime trend changes between years, and most common borough. Run the driver, pass the CSV file path, and view printed results.
