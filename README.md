# DNA-Project
DNA is a Java genetics simulator that represents DNA strands as linked nucleotide chains. It lets you construct and splice strands, scan for specific motifs/patterns, and apply mutations by inserting, removing, or swapping nucleotide segments. The project highlights efficient, string-like edits using linked-list operations instead of repeatedly rebuilding whole strings.
